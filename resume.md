# Summary

My passion lies in learning different applications of technology and applying them to my life and workflow. I pride myself on adapting to new situations and quickly learning what I need to do to be successful in a position, and I hope to bring that to my future endeavors. The world of data and data science especially intrigues me, and I hope to use those analytical skills to help make the world a better and more reliable place. I have been working in IT since my first job during high school, and through that experience I have developed a passion for technology that has pushed me forwards in my career.
